CPSC 350 Section 3
Assignment #3: Delimiter Syntax Checker

Source Files:

1. main.cpp
  NOTE: Didn't include another class because the assignment stated in
  code organization that there should be just GenStack.h and main.cpp.

Known runtime errors: NA

Instructions for running:
  1. The format of the text file leads to some differences. I ended up using
TextEdit with the file saved with the plain text encoding Unicode (UTF-8). The
way the delimiter is set to read the file, this won't work on a word document saved
with a .txt extension (a third parameter would need to be added to getline() specifiying
the delimiter '\r').
  2. The argument should be the location of the file
